## Audio Sorter

#### This script resolves the issue of losing audio filenames due to iTunes format incompatibilities.

The script uses the metadata from MP3 and M4A files to:

    1. Rename the files as the track's title.
    2. Create a mapping dictionary with all artists:albums:songs.
    3. Create directories for artists and subdirectories for albums based on the mapping structure.

The script is optimized for my own scenario -- no guarantee it will work in other situations.
