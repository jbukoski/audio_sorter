## Audio Sorter

#### This script resolves the issue of losing audio file names.

The script uses the metadata from MP3 and M4A files to:

    1. Rename the files.
    2. Create a mapping dictionary with all artists:albums:songs.
    3. Create directories based on the mapping structure.

The script is optimized for my own scenario -- no guaranttee it
will work in other situations.
